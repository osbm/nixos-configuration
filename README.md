# nixos is life
The nix configuration of mine. My intentions are just to maintain my configuration and to contribute to the nix community.

Here i have 4 machines and 1 sd card image that i maintain.
- Laptop **tartarus** (faulty hardware, nvidia gpu doesnt work)
- Desktop **ymir** (beast, my most prized possesion as of now)
- Raspberry Pi 5 **pochita** (a server that i experiment with)
- Raspberry Pi 5 SD image **pochita-sd** (produces an sd image that could be used to flash the sd card of a rpi-5)
- Phone **atreus** (unrooted, nix-on-droid)


I didnt get these setup yet.
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W **harmonica** (small machine for small tasks and cronjobs) (not setup yet)
- Android phone (termux) **android** (not setup yet)

## How to use raspberry pi 5

I have 2 configurations for the raspberry pi 5. One is for the sd card (basically bootstraps the system) and the other is for my customized system itself.

build the image first (this took about 4 hours on ymir (binfmt for aarch64 needs to be enabled if you are building on x86_64))
```sh
$ nix build -L '.#nixosConfigurations.pochita-sd.config.system.build.sdImage'
```

then to flash the image to the sd card enable zstd
```sh
$ nix-shell -p zstd
```

then flash the image to the sd card
```sh
$ zstdcat nixos-sd-image-24.05.20241116.e8c38b7-aarch64-linux.img.zst | dd of=/dev/sda status=progress
```

and voila! when you plug the sd card to the raspberry pi 5 it will boot up with the configuration that you have built. And then you can ssh into it and further configure it.
